# RobotGLaDOS

## This project is in the very early state.  I am building it out however I can practiclly work on it a few hours a week at best.

### The framework is getting filled out.  The robot is runnable and will open GOG and GWENT and then close GWENT.  I did not bind the login click correctly so I must wait to finish that until another day.

###//ToDo 2022-11-05 (My markdown program Typora started charging so no pretty formatting until I find a differnt one)
###Parameterize the digital distribution clients
###Parameterize the game paths relitive to the clients so each person only needs to map their clients
###Detail all the platforms; GOG, Riot, Steam, Uplay, Origin...
###Detail all the actual games; Brawlhalla, Dead By Daylight, Don't Starve Together, Fortnite, Gwent, Legends of Runeterra, Marvel Snap to start.
